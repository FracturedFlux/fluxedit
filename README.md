FluxEdit is (going to be) a simple, effective WorldEdit-like Datapack.
Right now, it's just cylinders. 
The cylinders are good, but it's just cylinders.

# Guide

## Cylinder

`solid` (0/1) True or False statement. If 1, the cylinder will be fully filled out. If 0, the cylinder will be a hollow tube.

`radius` (1+) Integer. The distance from the player that the outer edge of the cylinder will generate.

`height` (0+) Integer. The height of the cylinder, starting at 0. 0 is 1 block high, 1 is 2 blocks, etc.

`block` String. The block the cylinder will be made of. Works exactly like `/setblock` or `/fill` just without autocomplete.

`replace` String. Another block name. The block type that the cylinder will replace.
